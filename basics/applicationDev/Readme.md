Welcome to the Hammer Strength Game

This is a two-player game featuring a "red" and a "green" player.

The rules are simple. Just press the "Smash" button at the right moment to score the highest points.

The game is implemented using simple HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It uses images to represent the score meter and the hammer.

To animate the hammerâ€™s movement, transforms are used to rotate it.
For the needle, some mathematical calculations were applied to determine its angular velocity based on frames per second.
